<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

<img src="matthew_chin.png" alt="Matthew Chin in 2018" width=100 height=100>

<p>
My name is Matthew Chin, and I am a senior student at the University of San Francisco 
majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science, and I am expected to graduate in May 2021. 
After college, I hope to work in big tech in the fields of algorithms, software engineering or development, 
data science, and machine learning. 
</p>

<p> 
I have aspirations to attend graduate school, possibly in business, computer science, or data science, 
and have proficient knowledge in linear algebra, data structures and algorithms, database development, 
and customer service troubleshooting. At USF, I am a student help desk technician for their 
Information Technology Services (ITS), where I troubleshoot basic problems with account logins, 
software installation, and managing inventory. In today's context with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
I also respond to clients who may have issues accessing, setting up, or installing and updating to the 
latest version of Zoom for class meetings, webinars and conferences.
</p>
    
<p>
Aside from my work at USF, I have additional work experience. I interned at Carl Zeiss X-Ray Microscopy 
(XRM) where I developed a proof of concept for an inventory management database system using a barcode 
language which includes scanning location of items and, if necessary, any changes made. 
I have tutored middle and high school students in the Spanish language and in Mathematics, ranging from 
sixth grade math all the way to Pre-Calculus and Calculus.

<br>

I am the Media and Marketing Chair for the University chapter of Google Developer Student Clubs, in partnership with Google Developers.
I encourage student interest in Google products like Google Cloud, Firebase, TensorFlow, and maps, among others, and how to program on the terminal.  
I am responsible for managing the club's social media accounts and am the primary source for video production of select meetings and events for those 
who choose to participate in DSC events remotely. I make posts and posters and propose suggestions for our club's website developers to add and/or edit content.

I am one of the founding e-board members of this on-campus organization. To learn more about our club or organization, you can visit
<a href="https://dsc-usfca.appspot.com/">our website</a> for more information and if you would like to learn more about gaining practical experience with Google 
Developer products.

<p>

I am the Events Coordinator for USF Hackers Club. I organize meetings and events and provide helpful sites to gain further interests in cybersecurity.
The mission of the club is to encourage users in coding and ethical hacking, also by using a Raspberry Pi.

while balancing academics and other extracurricular activities.
