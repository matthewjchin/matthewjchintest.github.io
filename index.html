        My name is Matthew Chin, and I am a senior student at the University of San Francisco majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science, and I am expected to graduate in May 2021. 

       After college, I hope to work in big tech in the fields of algorithms, software engineering or development, data science, and machine learning. I have aspirations to attend graduate school, possibly in business, computer science, or data science, and have proficient knowledge in linear algebra, data structures and algorithms, database development, and customer service troubleshooting.

       At my university, I am a student help desk technician for their Information Technology Services (ITS), where I troubleshoot basic problems with account logins, software installation, and managing inventory. In today's context with regards to COVID-19, however, I also respond to clients who may have issues accessing, setting up, or installing Zoom for class meetings and conferences.
