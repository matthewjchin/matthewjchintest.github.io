    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

    <img src="matthew_chin.png" alt="Matthew Chin in 2018" width=100 height=100>

    <p>
    My name is Matthew Chin, and I am a senior student at the University of San Francisco majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science, and I am expected to graduate in May 2021. 
    After college, I hope to work in big tech in the fields of algorithms, software engineering or development, data science, and machine learning. 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
    I have aspirations to attend graduate school, possibly in business, computer science, or data science, and have proficient knowledge in linear algebra, data structures and algorithms, 
    database development, and customer service troubleshooting. 
    At my university, I am a student help desk technician for their Information Technology Services (ITS), where I troubleshoot basic problems with account logins, software installation, 
    and managing inventory. 
    In today's context with regards to COVID-19, I also respond to clients who may have issues accessing, setting up, or installing Zoom for class meetings and conferences.
    </p>
       
    <p>
    Aside from my work at USF, I have additional work experience. I interned at Carl Zeiss X-Ray Microscopy (XRM) where 
    I developed a proof of concept for an inventory management database system using a barcode language which includes scanning location of items and, if necessary, any changes made. 
    I have tutored middle and high school students in the Spanish language and in Mathematics, ranging from sixth grade  math all the way to Pre-Calculus and Calculus. 
    I am also an Amazon Prime Now Shopper at Whole Foods Market, employed by Amazon, Inc. in Northern California. 
    </p>
